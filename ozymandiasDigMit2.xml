    <speaker n="1">I met a traveller from an antique land,<lb n=""/> Who saidâ€”<speaker n="2"><q>Two vast
        and trunkless legs of stone <lb  n=""/> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the
        sand,<lb n=""/> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<lb n=""/> And wrinkled lip,
        and sneer of cold command,<lb n=""/> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<lb n=""/>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<lb n=""/> The hand that mocked them,
        and the heart that fed;<lb n=""/> And on the pedestal, these words appear:<lb n=""/> My name
        is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<lb n=""/> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<lb n=""/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<lb n=""/> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and
        bare<lb n=""/> The lone and level sands stretch far away.</q></speaker></speaker>
